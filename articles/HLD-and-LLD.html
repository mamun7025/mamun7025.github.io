<h1 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">System Design - HLD and LLD</h1>
<hr>

<p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">

What is System Design:
System design the process of designing a system(any software application). So while we start designing any software system few things we keep in mind.

What all features application will have.
How many users will access this.
At a time how many requests will come to the application.
How much we want to scale more our application and what is the allowed cost for that.
	
So keeping these things in mind we start developing applications. While developing any application we should think about real-world scenarios, like how other applications work(Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook) If we have an idea about this then we can easily develop our application also in a better way.

	

HLD:
  - Functional Requirements
  - Non Functional Requirements
  - Costing Limitations
      Consistency
      Availability
      Performance
      Scalalibity
  - Limitations of system

LLD:
  - Class diagram
  - ER Diagram
  - UML digram
  - Data Models
  - Interfaces define
  - Coding >>> write code for fetch all post, create new post and reply on post

HLD vs LLd
HLD:
	HLD is overall design process
	HLD is overall acrhitecture decription
	HLD - solution architects
	HLD converts client requirements into high level solution

LLD:
	LLD is component level design process
	LLD is each and evry module level description
	LLD - Designeres and Developers
	LLD converts high level solution to a detailed level implementation
